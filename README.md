# DroidFoodApplication
In this project we will call a api and get the data and display it, along with it we are caching it locally so that when your application is in offline, still we are able to display the data

| **Project is developed using the libraries** |

### ``Retrofit``

* Developer friendly library
* Easy to Configure
* Less boiler plate code
* Supports internal parsing using GSON,Jakson,Moshi, can be configured
* Supports caching
* Annotation based setting requests
* Supports error handeling
* Easy to define retry and timeouts using the interceptor
* Endpoint can be added in one place
* Support to FLOW api of coroutines
* Support to suspend function of coroutines
* Very well documented and tested

### ``Coil``

* Coil is a image loading library.
* Coil is built to work efficiently with kotlin.
* COIL loads images very faster with the number of optimizations which includes memory, disk caching, reusing of bitmaps, and down spacing the image in memory which makes it faster in comparison with other image loading libraries.
* Library very lightweight and easy to use because it adds around two thousand methods, to your APK which are very less in number in comparison with Picasso, Glide, and universal image loader.
* Library uses modern libraries of Android such as Okio, OkHttp, and AndroidX lifecycles.
* Library aoids annotation processing which can often slow down build speeds. Coil depends on Kotlin's extension functions instead.

### ``Kotlin-Dsl``

* Gradle is written in groovy programming language, But we write the rest of project in kotlin. using kotlin-dsl.
* Using the kotlin-dsl, we can organize the dependencies in our project more clean and in a efficient way.
* Type safety. Which allows better autocompletion which was missing from grovey till now.
* Code navigation between files becomes easy in Kotlin DSL.
* We can use all the functionalities of kotlin in our gradle file.
* Refactoring is much easier.
